class LOS(models.Model):
    """
    A LOS represents a pair of MeshDB Building objects which are able to see each other. This indicates
    they are potential candidates for linking together. In fact, this table is currently primarily useful
    for storing human-entered "potential" links.

    This is needed because unlike the legacy spreadsheet, MeshDB's Link table stores connections
    between Device objects, not between install numbers. This means among other things that in order
    to show a potential link on the map, we'd need to assign NNs to those buildings (very gross). Instead,
    with this table, we can represent potential links between any pair of street addresses (MeshDB
    Buildings), no need to create any other DB objects.
