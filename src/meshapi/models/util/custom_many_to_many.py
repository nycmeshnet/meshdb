https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/add-ability-to-define-custom-column-names-in-the-table-created-by-the-manytomanyfield/25427/6
except for two added lines (marked with "Andrew added me from the Django Forum post!")

We have exactly the same needs as the gentleman in this post. We want to rename the columns on the mapping table,
but don't want to make an additional through model and have to compromise on the helper functions, etc.
