    Helper function to encapsulate the validation logic for the attachment of an NN
    to a new node. We need to validate that the NN is unused as either an install number
    or network number on an existing node. However, there are some edge cases. For example,
    we allow an active install to have its number used as an NN for a node, if that node is
    attached to this install

    This validation logic is used for auto-assignment in the get_next_available_network_number()
    function below, but also on many Node.save() calls since vanity NNs can come in via the
    admin form and need to be validated prior to being committed to the DB

    Accepts an optional existing node id to exempt from validation, this allows
    assigning old install numbers to new nodes, even if the old installs are active,
    as long as you associate the node that is going to get the install number to that install before
    you try to assign the number to that node
